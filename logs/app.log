                        ## Electrical Connection

Minicap AC or DC connection and relay output.

- F1: Fine-wire fuse to protect the relay contact, dependent on the connected load
- F2: Fine-wire fuse, 500 mA
- M: Earth connection to silo or metal
- components on silo E: Earth

No ground lines (PE) or potential matching lines (PAL) are required with Minicap FTC 260.

Minicap with three-cable DC connection;

Transistor output PNP .

- F: Fine-wire fuse, 500 mA
- R: Connected load, e.g. PLC, PCS, relay
- M: Earth connection to silo or metal components on silo
- E: Earth

Minicap is protected against reverse polarity. The green LED for standby goes out if the connections are reversed.

No ground lines (PE) or potential matching lines (PAL) are required with Minicap FTC 260.

To ensure that the Minicap operates safely and without electrical interference, it must be connected to an earthed silo with metal or reinforced concrete walls.

For silos made of non-conductive materials, the external earth wire of the Minicap must be connected to a conductive and earthed component which is earthed near to the silo. The protective earth can be connected to the internal earth terminal of the Minicap.

Connections can be made with standard instrument cabling. See TI 241F/00/en for information on EMC (testing procedures, installation). Connect the potential matching lead (PAL) when using in dust explosion hazardous areas.

Note national regulations!

                        ## Measuring System

## Measuring Principle

Factory setting on switches

Table of application examples

Grey background: Application limits of Minicap exceeded. Recommendation: Soliphant FTM to be used.

In general:

If the dielectric constant of the solid is not known, then the density (apparent weight) of the solid is a deciding factor. Under normal conditions the Minicap functions in foodstuffs with a density of 250 g/l and above or in plastic or mineral materials with a density of 600 g/l and above.

Minicap is an electronic switch. The complete measuring system consists of:

-  a power supply and
-  the Minicap FTC 260 or FTC 262
-  controllers, switching devices, signal transmitters (e.g. lamps, horns, PCS, PLC, etc.)

Limit detection in silos containing solids

## Limit Detection

A metal plate at the end of the probe, within the insulation, and the integrated counter-electrode together with the surroundings combine to form the two electrodes of a capacitor.

If the probe is covered or free of material, then the capacitance changes and the Minicap switches.

## Active Build-up Compensation

The Minicap detects build-up on the probe and compensates for its effects so that the switch point is always accurate. The effects of build-up compensation depend on:

-  conductivity of the material,
-  the thickness of the build-up on the probe,
-  the sensitivity setting

on the electronic insert.

## Setting the Sensitivity

The Minicap is so calibrated at the factory that it correctly switches in most cases.

Greater sensitivity can be set using a multi-pole switch on the electronic insert. This is only necessary, however, if there is very strong build-up on the probe, or if the dielectric constant of the material e r is very small.

## Function Range

There is a loose relationship between the dielectric constant e r and density r of the material. However, this depends on the solid.

The table on the left indicates whether the Minicap can be used or if application limits are exceeded.

Calibration is the process of adjusting or standardizing the  analyzer  to  a  lab  test  or  a  calibrated  laboratory instrument, or standardizing to some known reference (such as a commercial buffer).

This  section  covers  the  following  programming  and configuration functions:

The auto-recognition feature of the analyzer will enable the appropriate calibration screens to allow calibration for any single sensor configuration or dual sensor configuration of the analyzer.  Completion of Quick Start upon first power up enables live measurements but does not ensure  accurate  readings  in  the  lab  or  in  process. Calibration  should  be  performed  with  each  attached sensor to ensure accurate, repeatable readings.

                        ## 7.2 pH Calibration

New sensors must be calibrated before use. Regular recalibration is also necessary. Use auto calibration instead of manual calibration.  Auto calibration avoids common pitfalls and reduces errors.  The analyzer recognizes the buffers and uses temperature-corrected pH values in the calibration. Once the Model 1056 successfully completes the calibration, it calculates and displays the calibration slope and offset. The slope is reported as the slope at 25C.

                        ## 7.2 pH Calibration

New sensors must be calibrated before use. Regular recalibration is also necessary. Use auto calibration instead of manual calibration.  Auto calibration avoids common pitfalls and reduces errors.  The analyzer recognizes the buffers and uses temperature-corrected pH values in the calibration. Once the Model 1056 successfully completes the calibration, it calculates and displays the calibration slope and offset. The slope is reported as the slope at 25C.

Calibration is the process of adjusting or standardizing the  analyzer  to  a  lab  test  or  a  calibrated  laboratory instrument, or standardizing to some known reference (such as a commercial buffer).

This  section  covers  the  following  programming  and configuration functions:

The auto-recognition feature of the analyzer will enable the appropriate calibration screens to allow calibration for any single sensor configuration or dual sensor configuration of the analyzer.  Completion of Quick Start upon first power up enables live measurements but does not ensure  accurate  readings  in  the  lab  or  in  process. Calibration  should  be  performed  with  each  attached sensor to ensure accurate, repeatable readings.

                        ## 7.2 pH Calibration

New sensors must be calibrated before use. Regular recalibration is also necessary. Use auto calibration instead of manual calibration.  Auto calibration avoids common pitfalls and reduces errors.  The analyzer recognizes the buffers and uses temperature-corrected pH values in the calibration. Once the Model 1056 successfully completes the calibration, it calculates and displays the calibration slope and offset. The slope is reported as the slope at 25C.

## 7.2.1 Description

CTB 7040 carbide panel saws

## CTB 7040

the CTB 400 is the industry standard in the field of compact carbide saw machines. Small machine dimensions in conjunction with a strong drive make the CTB 400 the ideal basis for our automation solutions.

The CTB 7040 is an extremely high-performance panel saw also especially for tool steel with a working range of 430 mm (height) x 700 mm (width). Therefore, the machine is the ideal precursor to precision panel manufacturing with AMADA duplex milling machines of the THV series.

## SAWING TECHNOLOGY

When compared to conventional band saws, the CTB 400 / CTB 7040 is so fast that it only requires a third of the time compared to conventional machining.

However, the CTB 400 / CTB 7040 models also offer a variety of technical highlights in other areas.

The CTB 400 / CTB 7040 also work with very low vibration; this reduces the noise level, increases the cutting quality and guides to an increased band saw blade life time. The construction was greatly improved for this performance:

- The material table and saw frame are separated. 
- The machines are equipped with a special saw guide close to  the material.
- All feed rates are with high precision, ensured by linear guides. 
- The frequency-controlled direct drive supplies high power, but the  7.5 kW saves considerable amount of power.
- The machines are equipped with two hydraulic clamping vices  with automatic zero positioning.
- The sawing process is controlled via the CNC control with  integrated material database.

## Automatic high performance thanks to optimum technology.

With the CTB 400 / CTB 7040, everything is perfectly matched this results in impressive cutting performance. For example, thanks to the stored information, the controller automatically ensures optimum feed pressure and cutting speed. Also, because perfect tuning of the machine and tools increases the performance, Amada has developed a particularly powerful carbide saw blade especially for the CTB 400 / CTB 7040.

                        ## Measuring System

## Measuring Principle

Factory setting on switches

Table of application examples

Grey background: Application limits of Minicap exceeded. Recommendation: Soliphant FTM to be used.

In general:

If the dielectric constant of the solid is not known, then the density (apparent weight) of the solid is a deciding factor. Under normal conditions the Minicap functions in foodstuffs with a density of 250 g/l and above or in plastic or mineral materials with a density of 600 g/l and above.

Minicap is an electronic switch. The complete measuring system consists of:

-  a power supply and
-  the Minicap FTC 260 or FTC 262
-  controllers, switching devices, signal transmitters (e.g. lamps, horns, PCS, PLC, etc.)

Limit detection in silos containing solids

## Limit Detection

A metal plate at the end of the probe, within the insulation, and the integrated counter-electrode together with the surroundings combine to form the two electrodes of a capacitor.

If the probe is covered or free of material, then the capacitance changes and the Minicap switches.

## Active Build-up Compensation

The Minicap detects build-up on the probe and compensates for its effects so that the switch point is always accurate. The effects of build-up compensation depend on:

-  conductivity of the material,
-  the thickness of the build-up on the probe,
-  the sensitivity setting

on the electronic insert.

## Setting the Sensitivity

The Minicap is so calibrated at the factory that it correctly switches in most cases.

Greater sensitivity can be set using a multi-pole switch on the electronic insert. This is only necessary, however, if there is very strong build-up on the probe, or if the dielectric constant of the material e r is very small.

## Function Range

There is a loose relationship between the dielectric constant e r and density r of the material. However, this depends on the solid.

The table on the left indicates whether the Minicap can be used or if application limits are exceeded.

Table of application examples

Grey background: Application limits of Minicap exceeded. Recommendation: Soliphant FTM to be used.

In general:

If the dielectric constant of the solid is not known, then the density (apparent weight) of the solid is a deciding factor. Under normal conditions the Minicap functions in foodstuffs with a density of 250 g/l and above or in plastic or mineral materials with a density of 600 g/l and above.

Minicap is an electronic switch. The complete measuring system consists of:

-  a power supply and
-  the Minicap FTC 260 or FTC 262
-  controllers, switching devices, signal transmitters (e.g. lamps, horns, PCS, PLC, etc.)

Limit detection in silos containing solids

## Limit Detection

A metal plate at the end of the probe, within the insulation, and the integrated counter-electrode together with the surroundings combine to form the two electrodes of a capacitor.

If the probe is covered or free of material, then the capacitance changes and the Minicap switches.

## Active Build-up Compensation

The Minicap detects build-up on the probe and compensates for its effects so that the switch point is always accurate. The effects of build-up compensation depend on:

-  conductivity of the material,
-  the thickness of the build-up on the probe,
-  the sensitivity setting

on the electronic insert.

## Setting the Sensitivity

The Minicap is so calibrated at the factory that it correctly switches in most cases.

Greater sensitivity can be set using a multi-pole switch on the electronic insert. This is only necessary, however, if there is very strong build-up on the probe, or if the dielectric constant of the material e r is very small.

## Function Range

There is a loose relationship between the dielectric constant e r and density r of the material. However, this depends on the solid.

2025-05-06 17:19:11,450 - INFO - bedrock_inv.aws_api - Response : The Minicap is designed to detect a variety of materials, including:

*   Grain, seed, legumes, and their products
*   Minerals, inorganic materials
*   Plastics

The Minicap can detect these materials by measuring the capacitance between the probe and the surrounding material. The capacitance changes when the probe is covered or free of material, allowing the Minicap to switch on or off.

The Minicap is particularly useful for detecting materials with a high dielectric constant, such as grain, seed, and legumes. It can also detect materials with a low dielectric constant, such as minerals and plastics, but may require a higher sensitivity setting.

The Minicap is not suitable for detecting all types of materials. For example, it may not be able to detect materials with a very low dielectric constant, such as air or water. Additionally, the Minicap may not be able to detect materials that are highly conductive, such as metals.

Overall, the Minicap is a versatile device that can be used to detect a wide range of materials. However, it is important to carefully consider the properties of the material being detected and to adjust the sensitivity setting accordingly to ensure accurate results.

                        ## Measuring System

## Measuring Principle

Factory setting on switches

Table of application examples

Grey background: Application limits of Minicap exceeded. Recommendation: Soliphant FTM to be used.

In general:

If the dielectric constant of the solid is not known, then the density (apparent weight) of the solid is a deciding factor. Under normal conditions the Minicap functions in foodstuffs with a density of 250 g/l and above or in plastic or mineral materials with a density of 600 g/l and above.

Minicap is an electronic switch. The complete measuring system consists of:

-  a power supply and
-  the Minicap FTC 260 or FTC 262
-  controllers, switching devices, signal transmitters (e.g. lamps, horns, PCS, PLC, etc.)

Limit detection in silos containing solids

## Limit Detection

A metal plate at the end of the probe, within the insulation, and the integrated counter-electrode together with the surroundings combine to form the two electrodes of a capacitor.

If the probe is covered or free of material, then the capacitance changes and the Minicap switches.

## Active Build-up Compensation

The Minicap detects build-up on the probe and compensates for its effects so that the switch point is always accurate. The effects of build-up compensation depend on:

-  conductivity of the material,
-  the thickness of the build-up on the probe,
-  the sensitivity setting

on the electronic insert.

## Setting the Sensitivity

The Minicap is so calibrated at the factory that it correctly switches in most cases.

Greater sensitivity can be set using a multi-pole switch on the electronic insert. This is only necessary, however, if there is very strong build-up on the probe, or if the dielectric constant of the material e r is very small.

## Function Range

There is a loose relationship between the dielectric constant e r and density r of the material. However, this depends on the solid.

The table on the left indicates whether the Minicap can be used or if application limits are exceeded.

                        ## Installation Hints FTC 260

General information and recommendations for installing the Minicap FTC 260 limit switch

<!-- image -->

## Correct Installation

## Incorrect Installation

a) Minimum distance: To prevent mutual interference with the FTC 260, the probes must be at least 200 mm from each other.

## b) Mounting point:

The tip of the probes must point slightly downwards so that the material can slide off more easily. The protective cover protects the probe rod from collapsing mounds or mechanical strain at the outflow when the Minicap FTC 260 is set to minimum detection.

## c) Mechanical load:

The maximum lateral load on the probe rod must be taken into account when used for minimum detection. It should therefore only be used for minimum detection with loose materials that have good flow characteristics.

- d) The probe can be damaged by the inflowing material and cause faulty switching.
- Cable gland pointed upwards can allow moisture to enter.
- e) Threaded socket too long with material build-up on the silo wall. (less than the minimum mounting depth of 100 mm).
- f) Mounted near build-up in the silo. The probe tip is too near to a silo wall (less than a minimum distance of 200 mm).

                        Query: What installation precautions should be taken for the Minicap FTC 260?

2025-05-06 17:20:00,071 - INFO - bedrock_inv.aws_api - Response : To ensure proper installation of the Minicap FTC 260, follow these guidelines:

**Minimum Distance**: Maintain a minimum distance of 200 mm between probes to prevent mutual interference.

**Mounting Point**: Position the probe tip slightly downwards to facilitate easy material flow and prevent collapse or mechanical strain at the outflow when set to minimum detection.

**Mechanical Load**: Consider the maximum lateral load on the probe rod when using it for minimum detection. It is recommended for use with loose materials that have good flow characteristics.

**Additional Precautions**:

* Avoid damaging the probe with inflowing material, which can cause faulty switching.
* Ensure the cable gland is not pointed upwards to prevent moisture entry.
* Use a threaded socket that is not too long to avoid material buildup on the silo wall (minimum mounting depth of 100 mm).
* Mount the probe away from build-up in the silo, maintaining a minimum distance of 200 mm from the silo wall.

By following these guidelines, you can ensure proper installation and optimal performance of the Minicap FTC 260.

- F1: Fine-wire fuse to protect the relay contact, dependent on the connected load
- F2: Fine-wire fuse, 500 mA
- M: Earth connection to silo or metal
- components on silo E: Earth

No ground lines (PE) or potential matching lines (PAL) are required with Minicap FTC 260.

Minicap with three-cable DC connection;

Transistor output PNP .

- F: Fine-wire fuse, 500 mA
- R: Connected load, e.g. PLC, PCS, relay
- M: Earth connection to silo or metal components on silo
- E: Earth

Minicap is protected against reverse polarity. The green LED for standby goes out if the connections are reversed.

No ground lines (PE) or potential matching lines (PAL) are required with Minicap FTC 260.

To ensure that the Minicap operates safely and without electrical interference, it must be connected to an earthed silo with metal or reinforced concrete walls.

For silos made of non-conductive materials, the external earth wire of the Minicap must be connected to a conductive and earthed component which is earthed near to the silo. The protective earth can be connected to the internal earth terminal of the Minicap.

Connections can be made with standard instrument cabling. See TI 241F/00/en for information on EMC (testing procedures, installation). Connect the potential matching lead (PAL) when using in dust explosion hazardous areas.

## Note

All instruments are shipped with two 4-20 mA current outputs.  Wiring locations for the outputs are on the Main board which is mounted on the hinged door of the instrument. Wire the output leads to the correct  position on the Main board using the lead markings (+/positive, -/negative) on the board. Male mating connectors are provided with each unit.

Twisted pairs are required to minimize noise pickup in 4-20 mA current outputs. For high EMI/RFI environments, shielded sensor wire is required and recommended in all other installations.

Four alarm relays are supplied with the switching power supply (85 to 265VAC, -03 order code) and the 24VDC power supply (20-30 VDC, -02 order code).  Wire the relay leads on each of the independent relays to the correct position on the power supply board using the printed lead markings (NO/Normally Open, NC/Normally Closed, or Com/Common) on the board.  See Fig 3-4.

Figure 3-5 Alarm Relay Wiring for Model 1056 Switching Power Supply (-03 Order Code)

Wire the correct sensor leads to the measurement board using the lead locations marked directly on the  board. After wiring the sensor leads to the signal board, carefully slide the wired board fully into the enclosure slot and take up the excess sensor cable through the cable gland.

## 3.4.4   Sensor Wiring to Signal Boards

For  best  EMI/RFI  protection  use  shielded  output  signal  cable  enclosed  in  an  earth-grounded  metal  conduit. Connect the shield to earth ground.  AC wiring should be 14 gauge or greater. Provide a switch or breaker to disconnect the analyzer from the main power supply. Install the switch or breaker near the analyzer and label it as the disconnecting device for the analyzer.

Twisted pairs are required to minimize noise pickup in the flow and current sensor inputs. For high EMI/RFI environments, shielded sensor wire is required and recommended in all other installations.

Keep sensor and output signal wiring separate from power wiring. Do not run sensor and power wiring in the sameconduit or close together in a cable tray. NOTE:

                        ## 3.4.2   Current Output Wiring 00809-0100-3156

## Note

All instruments are shipped with two 4-20 mA current outputs.  Wiring locations for the outputs are on the Main board which is mounted on the hinged door of the instrument. Wire the output leads to the correct  position on the Main board using the lead markings (+/positive, -/negative) on the board. Male mating connectors are provided with each unit.

Twisted pairs are required to minimize noise pickup in 4-20 mA current outputs. For high EMI/RFI environments, shielded sensor wire is required and recommended in all other installations.

Four alarm relays are supplied with the switching power supply (85 to 265VAC, -03 order code) and the 24VDC power supply (20-30 VDC, -02 order code).  Wire the relay leads on each of the independent relays to the correct position on the power supply board using the printed lead markings (NO/Normally Open, NC/Normally Closed, or Com/Common) on the board.  See Fig 3-4.

<!-- image -->

Figure 3-5 Alarm Relay Wiring for Model 1056 Switching Power Supply (-03 Order Code)

Wire the correct sensor leads to the measurement board using the lead locations marked directly on the  board. After wiring the sensor leads to the signal board, carefully slide the wired board fully into the enclosure slot and take up the excess sensor cable through the cable gland.

## 3.4.4   Sensor Wiring to Signal Boards

For  best  EMI/RFI  protection  use  shielded  output  signal  cable  enclosed  in  an  earth-grounded  metal  conduit. Connect the shield to earth ground.  AC wiring should be 14 gauge or greater. Provide a switch or breaker to disconnect the analyzer from the main power supply. Install the switch or breaker near the analyzer and label it as the disconnecting device for the analyzer.

Twisted pairs are required to minimize noise pickup in the flow and current sensor inputs. For high EMI/RFI environments, shielded sensor wire is required and recommended in all other installations.

Keep sensor and output signal wiring separate from power wiring. Do not run sensor and power wiring in the sameconduit or close together in a cable tray. NOTE:

['Output signal wiring and configuration are handled by connecting the correct sensor leads to the measurement board using the lead locations marked directly on the board. After wiring the sensor leads to the signal board, carefully slide the wired board fully into the enclosure slot and take up the excess sensor cable through the cable gland. For best EMI/RFI protection, use shielded output signal cable enclosed in an earth-grounded metal conduit. Connect the shield to earth ground. AC wiring should be 14 gauge or greater. Provide a switch or breaker to disconnect the analyzer from the main power supply. Install the switch or breaker near the analyzer and label it as the disconnecting device for the analyzer. Twisted pairs are required to minimize noise pickup in the flow and current sensor inputs. For high EMI/RFI environments, shielded sensor wire is required and recommended in all other installations. Keep sensor and output signal wiring separate from power wiring. Do not run sensor and power wiring in the same conduit or close together in a cable tray.', "To troubleshoot unstable pH readings, refer to the troubleshooting guide for the PH Analyzer. However, the provided text does not specifically address pH readings.

                        ## Measuring System

## Measuring Principle

Factory setting on switches

Table of application examples

Grey background: Application limits of Minicap exceeded. Recommendation: Soliphant FTM to be used.

In general:

If the dielectric constant of the solid is not known, then the density (apparent weight) of the solid is a deciding factor. Under normal conditions the Minicap functions in foodstuffs with a density of 250 g/l and above or in plastic or mineral materials with a density of 600 g/l and above.

Minicap is an electronic switch. The complete measuring system consists of:

-  a power supply and
-  the Minicap FTC 260 or FTC 262
-  controllers, switching devices, signal transmitters (e.g. lamps, horns, PCS, PLC, etc.)

Limit detection in silos containing solids

## Limit Detection

A metal plate at the end of the probe, within the insulation, and the integrated counter-electrode together with the surroundings combine to form the two electrodes of a capacitor.

If the probe is covered or free of material, then the capacitance changes and the Minicap switches.

## Active Build-up Compensation

The Minicap detects build-up on the probe and compensates for its effects so that the switch point is always accurate. The effects of build-up compensation depend on:

-  conductivity of the material,
-  the thickness of the build-up on the probe,
-  the sensitivity setting

on the electronic insert.

## Setting the Sensitivity

The Minicap is so calibrated at the factory that it correctly switches in most cases.

Greater sensitivity can be set using a multi-pole switch on the electronic insert. This is only necessary, however, if there is very strong build-up on the probe, or if the dielectric constant of the material e r is very small.

## Function Range

There is a loose relationship between the dielectric constant e r and density r of the material. However, this depends on the solid.

The table on the left indicates whether the Minicap can be used or if application limits are exceeded.

## Active Build-up Compensation

The Minicap detects build-up on the probe and compensates for its effects so that the switch point is always accurate. The effects of build-up compensation depend on:

-  conductivity of the material,
-  the thickness of the build-up on the probe,
-  the sensitivity setting

on the electronic insert.

## Setting the Sensitivity

The Minicap is so calibrated at the factory that it correctly switches in most cases.

Greater sensitivity can be set using a multi-pole switch on the electronic insert. This is only necessary, however, if there is very strong build-up on the probe, or if the dielectric constant of the material e r is very small.

## Function Range

There is a loose relationship between the dielectric constant e r and density r of the material. However, this depends on the solid.

The table on the left indicates whether the Minicap can be used or if application limits are exceeded.
